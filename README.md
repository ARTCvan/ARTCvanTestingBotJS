# ARTCvanHotelDiscordBot
Place to store my code for a Discord bot I am creating.

## What is the bot about?
As of now, its intended purpose is to response to member messages when a certain command is typed.

Specifically, it's meant for an in-game Minecraft company, called "ARTCvan's Hotel".

## Can I use this code?
Yes totally! This code isn't anything "top-secret" so I'm fine with people using the code, so long as you mention my GitHub name in the process.

### Commands
$help - tells you what the bot is for and the commands available for use.
$support - tells you how to get support for your issue (in this case, booking).

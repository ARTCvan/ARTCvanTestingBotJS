# ARTCvanTestingBotJS
Place to store my code for a Discord bot I was creating.

## What is the bot about?
As of now, its intended purpose is to be a bot I can test stuff on.

## Can I use this code?
Yes totally! This code isn't anything "top-secret" so I'm fine with people using the code, so long as you mention my GitHub name in the process.

## Is there an invite link for the bot?
I don't recommend you to invite the bot as it is intended for one server only, however if you would like to test out the bot, you can invite it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=971260178940985434&permissions=8&scope=bot). The URL is [https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=971260178940985434&permissions=8&scope=bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=971260178940985434&permissions=8&scope=bot).

You must have the Administrator permission in order to invite the bot on the server of your choosing.

### Commands
$help - tells you what the bot is for and the commands available for use.

$support - tells you how to get support for your issue (in this case, booking).

Many other easter eggs are in this bot, see if you can find the commands to active them!

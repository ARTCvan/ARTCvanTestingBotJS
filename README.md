# ARTCvanHotelDiscordBot
Place to store my code for a Discord bot I am creating.

## What is the bot about?
As of now, its intended purpose is to response to member messages when a certain command is typed.

Specifically, it's meant for an in-game Minecraft company, called "ARTCvan's Hotel".

## Can I use this code?
Yes totally! This code isn't anything "top-secret" so I'm fine with people using the code, so long as you mention my GitHub name in the process.

## Is there an invite link for the bot?
I don't recommend you to invite the bot as it is intended for one server only, however if you would like to test out the bot, you can invite it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=971260178940985434&permissions=8&scope=bot). The URL is [https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=971260178940985434&permissions=8&scope=bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=971260178940985434&permissions=8&scope=bot).

You must have the Administrator permission in order to invite the bot on the server of your choosing.

### Commands
$help - tells you what the bot is for and the commands available for use.

$support - tells you how to get support for your issue (in this case, booking).

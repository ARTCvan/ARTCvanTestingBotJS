# DEPRECIATED: DO NOT USE. 

# ARTCvanTestingBotJS
Place to store my code for a Discord bot I was creating.

## What is the bot about?
As of now, its intended purpose is to be a bot I can test stuff on.

## Is there an invite link for the bot?
At this point the bot is no longer being developed so invites have been disabled, alongside the fact that the Raspberry Pi is not online as of now.

### Commands
$help - tells you what the bot is for and the commands available for use.

Many other easter eggs are in this bot, see if you can find the commands to active them!
